The Flow and the Notion


foreword { : instructions }
this publication
starts with the very first image
(the one on the cover)
manifesting itself through the outlined streams of
concentric shapes, emanations, aerodynamic flows,
light-wave refractions, mountains, lakes, waters,
clouds, energy currents, ink, paper, intentions,
reflections, isobars, smoothed-out approximations.
...
the practice
that it proposes
is based on observing the movements
in their solidification.
it may be patterns on stones
reflecting layers and layers of epochs
it may be light waves
refracting into the clouds
the blue and the white
making new shapes
along the way.
it may even be musical waves
or any kind of waves;
watching phase spaces
of their propagation.
foreword { : instructions }
resonance in perception.
...
{ : plotting the outlines of a process,
: tracing the patterns of movement }
...
the same way a thought
or even a word,
a concept,
a story,
a situation,
has multiple ways to refract itself
onto the surface of interpretative circuits.
exposing several layers of meanings,
perspectives,
perceptions,
appearances,
sentiments, waves,
oscillations, and feelings.

i found it online a long time ago.
benevolent algorithms sync,
communication is established,
we meet.
at the time, we didn’t continue
but you’ve kept that image
for me.
our lives diverged,
we wandered.

and then, one day,
we meet again, we align. we resonate.

you draw, i write.
maybe not at the same time
maybe not in the same place

you could as well be dancing

i could as well be searching
and you could just be playing along.

{ : creating together }
...
i could be writing the text for this book
word-codes assembled as cognitive stimulants,
you could as well be constructing
the forms, the concentric shapes, the outlines
made of all those little strokes
every one of them revealing
several layers of movement
within solid matter,

concentric shapes,
emanating,
bringing the traces of life (path)
to the surface
of the material.

{ : building it up from small parts }

often at odds with itself [or oneself],
looking for confrontation //
with meaning and paradox,
discovering polysingularity of perception,
standing alone.
observing from many different
perspectives
whatever it is that is passing by,
moving along,
learning to navigate through the objects
their outlines
their shadows // and not only

with our gaze alone.

1. Unfathomable Loneliness

Now
that those days are gone
And the rooms are brighter
with the light
that we couldn’t see before
And the air is fuller
with the silence
that we couldn’t hear before
Let’s embrace
this newly found emptiness
silently observe
and give in
To the breeze
of this newly found air.

2. The Dream and the Reason
There is a particular moment
within a dream,
When one realizes
that it is a dream.
The first thought:
“What a superb rendering of reality!”
Every shape, every color, every constellation –
all this is a product of imagination.

After the initial appreciation
has subsided,
(and somehow it always does)
the question arises:
what is to be done?
What can one do
with reality
so perfectly rendered?
The dream is no longer a dream
when grasped by reason.
It gradually fades away,
slipping
through one’s eyelashes.
Until one wakes up.

A question remains,
the thought is no longer
a product of imagination,
reality aligns itself
along those lines.
_
The question is gradually slipping away
through those eyelashes
until one wakes up.




3. The Operational Strategy
of Desire
The more something is lacking
the more it is needed.
...
The absence produces desire.
The presence precedes the absence.
...
a sudden distraction
extraction
...
...
expectation
...

Retaliation.

4. Unities
Some unities
are more remarkable than others,
because they stand out
from the rest.

5. Quint~essence

Dis~cussion of es~sence.
What is the essence of things?
What is the essence of this question?
This is absolutely essential.
“The very essence of this idea...”
...
The essential weakness of this,
the essential weakness of that.
It is essential to realize that whatever it is that is
realized is essential to the process of realization.
It is essential to keep up-to-date records.
To keep the essence.
It is an essential part of the process.
The essence is the essential part of the process.
....
There is no essence.
S/he has no essence.
It has no essence.
The essence evaporated.
(How many times did I ask you not to use that word?)
...
...
...

...

The essence of this question is to understand what
is of real essence to us.
The essence is still there.
Essentially, what they are trying to do is
_________.
That’s the essence.
The essential parts of this device are protected
against any electrical or otherwise surge and will
complete their program automatically without any
intervention from therein.

Quint~essence.


6. Closer

In the end,
we are all
just trying
to get closer
to ourselves.



7. Slave to the Inner Totem

Slave to the circumstances.
Slave to external demands.

Slave of the fact that a washing machine is a really
convenient thing to use, however, it consumes a lot of
electricity and water, so it’s not the most eco-friendly option
out there.

8. Magic (Procedure)
The question of magic has been explored
from various angles and
in many different directions.
If it is a hint at something unreal
its essence might be
better left alone.
We would, however, be curious
to explore the traces of a magical process,
hoping that they would lead us into a different realm,
which may, or may not, speak for itself.
...
Whatever it is
that is magical
unfolds
and reveals itself.
The movement starts somewhere
the attention may not really reach.
It travels throughout the body
or any other substance.
x˙ = σ(y − x)
y˙ = rx − y − xz
z˙ = xy − bz


Creating the space and time
(it needs)
emanating
into concentric shapes.
Each iteration is slightly reminiscent of another,
but every one of them differs
in its own way.
The traces of magic are plotted as phase spaces
[Figure ∞].
Therefore it can be claimed with a relatively high degree
of confidence that magic reveals itself through so-called
strange attractors, which represent chaotic behavior.
...
The movement continues. It has a high degree of variability,
but also is highly organized. It advances through the very
matter that it itself creates.
Then it encounters something else
and comes into relation with it.
This something else
is some form of entity
that we separate from the rest
for the sake of simplicity,
even though, really,
it is still a part of the same thing.
This thing
form
entity
encounters the substance
of the shape
that it itself produces.
Manifests the traces of this encounter
into space,
diffuses
into the material.
…
Materialization.

The river Sacer
flows into concentric shapes
becoming the mountain of creation.
The new forms emerge
in the vessel of the Earth.
A cloud solidifies
evaporation of its own beauty,
the flow sends its steam upwards,
pure metabolism,
hands in the air,
crucifixion,
subjugated like syntax,
gravity liberated.


9. Partial Wisdom

It is easy
to inspect an object
to determine
which properties it has
by attempting
to retrieve those properties
and examining
the values obtained.
O!
This is all
there is to say
About objects
and their properties.

Unless we don’t go
into the multiplicity
of relations
that emerge
from this encounter
and all the other relations
especially between
the sign and the meaning.

10. The Bow and the Arrow

I had a dream about you.
Or maybe it was a dream about myself.
It was in some kind of a beautiful forest, but there
were not too many trees. Almost none. Maybe it was a
Siberian steppe. Some hills surrounding it, far way.
There was a man, a very strong man, and he was
showing me his bow. He placed an arrow, tightened
the bow string, and then, suddenly, I could see where
he was aiming… as if I myself were aiming through a
telescopic lens.
It was very far away. Maybe ten kilometers, maybe a
hundred. I could only see a few people. Like a family.
All huddled together, a mother and a child between
them. They were dressed somewhat traditionally, but
also quite casually. Kind of happy, smiling.
The next thing I knew, the bowstring was about to be
released and the arrow would shoot right into that
family.
The aim lowered down from the mother to the child,
where the arrow would hit.
But it didn’t seem to matter or to be something bad.
Neither did it seem like somebody would die from it,
really, or maybe they would. Regardless, it would have
a very strong effect. It was as if something like this had
to happen, and the man who was shooting the arrows
was just doing what needed to be done. An outside
force was in play there.
It was impressive.
Then there was this bag of things that the man had.
It seemed like he received something and put it into
that bag after each shot was made. Like a reward of
some kind, or maybe just an acknowledgement. Inside
there were candles. Many different candles of different
shapes and sizes, but also very simple white ones.
…
Suddenly it was you who was showing me the bag with
the candles and it was a bit different than the man’s. I
told you the story of what I’d seen. How the man and
his bow left a strong impression on me.


You said that you also had a bow, that you had been
practicing for a long time. You showed it to me and it
was smaller than the man’s bow, a very cute little bow,
but a powerful one. Perhaps as powerful as the man’s.
You said that if you aim right, it can shoot very far and
very precisely. And that you’d been practicing for a long
time. You also mentioned that you’d stopped practicing
for a while, but that you were going to start again, very
soon, maybe even now.
It seemed like it was a dangerous path because, as I’ve
seen before, the bow could be a lethal weapon. Yet it
didn’t seem to be a problem or that it would be bad even
if it were to hurt somebody. There was this feeling that
with power comes responsibility. And we both knew
it. We said that as long as you aim right and shoot far,
it would all make sense and even beyond that, it would
be accomplishing some higher mission. The bow would
grow too, with practice.
So it seemed like a matter of choice. Having that small
bow as a souvenir or a toy of some sort (still a powerful
one), or allowing it to grow, honing the art of shooting
the arrows, aiming precisely and far, towards the
unknown or maybe even choosing targets. It seemed
exciting.
…
You were sitting in front of me. It was some time after
that previous encounter. Maybe only a few minutes.
Then you moved closer to me, so I was right next to you.
I put my nose close to your left cheek, you smelled nice.
I started biting your neck, just a little bit, in a playful
way, almost not sexual. You said it felt nice and that
when you’d asked your mother who you should take
with you, she’d said it would have to be me, which
seemed very right to both of us somehow. Then you
mentioned something about the bite, like it was tickling
and it felt good, and then we giggled, and I stopped and
woke up.
A lonely bird was singing beautifully outside in the
middle of the night.


11. Security
There is a thing
about security:
It positions itself
On the border
between whatever it is
that is allowed
and that which is not.
whatever it is
that is protected
and that which is not.
whatever it is
that is concealed
and that which is not.
In this way
to be on the side of security
is to be as close as possible
to insecurity
but to never enter
into that other realm
where predictability
is lacking.


12. Corrupted Innocence

If there is something inside the innocence
that wants to be corrupted,
It is the total lack of resistance
towards the eyes of beholder.
Surrender.
If there is something inside the corruption
that is attracted towards the innocent,
It is the promise of full control.
Irresistible.
…
“I surrender”, “I give myself up to you”
fully, unequivocally, completely.
cannot re~sist,
ir~resistible,
full diffusion.

13. Mediated by Synchrony

The most plausible mechanism
for large-scale integration
is the formation
of dynamic links
mediated by synchrony
over multiple frequency bands.

14. Dream~Catcher
There are some dreams in this world
that are more possible
than others.
There are some streams in this world
that are less visible
than others.
...
It is those streams
that the dream~catcher
is tuned into.
